    "SQL stands for 'Structured Query Language', which perfectly describes what it does. It is a bespoke programming language designed for **query structured datasets**, specifically, relational databases. **Relational** databases are databases which are **related** by common columns - i.e. they have a common 'property' which links the data in some way. For example if you were to have two databases comprising defining characteristics of a building and of people, they could be related by the fact that they both have the property of height."
